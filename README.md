🐍 My Python Learning Recap

Through a program called Launchpad Philly, I joined a team that helped me dive deeper into Python in preparation for earning my PCEP certification.
During this time, I worked on solving a variety of coding challenges and even created a Magic 8 Ball program 🎱, which required using multiple if statements and while loops 🚀
